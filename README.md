How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

 -One of the most important ways that I can ensure my software is functional and secure is by having a testing mentality throughout the development process, and using testing techniques such as code review, white box testing and blackbox testing  to verify my work product. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

-I interpret user needs by understanding what their goal is or what they are trying to accomplish. To do this I ask them lots of questions from different perspectives. I will also walk them through mock scenarios so we both have the same understanding of the objective.

How do I approach designing software?

- I design software through an iterative step by step approach. I start with the big picture and then zoom in on the details.
